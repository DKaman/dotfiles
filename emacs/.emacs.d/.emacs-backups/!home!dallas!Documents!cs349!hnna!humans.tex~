\section{Questions}
\label{sec-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Despite the points made in the video, I believe that creative jobs like musicians and writers are going to last
   20 years.
\item I believe this because even with all of the complex analysis computers can do on our language, the best they can
   do is take from ideas that are already developed.  I don't believe in the next 20 years a computer can
   create something that touches on human emotion and not be completely derived from already existing ideas.  The 
   symbolic nature of emotion and philosophy is something I think is unique to human thought (as we know it) and 
   something I think a computer would have a very hard time recreating.
